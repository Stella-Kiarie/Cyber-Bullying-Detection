@AdnanOjoji,bro there's something negative about being brought up by single mothers. not to judge but watoto wakikosa father figure who's there to discipline his kids expect the worse. mwanaume knows reality ya maisha ni kuji sacrifice not trying to be happy always. as in a man knows life has to be tackled logically not emotionally. sasa upate watoto wamekosa that figure in their early life it's going to damage. mwanamke hawezi pressure za maisha kupita kiasi zikiwashinda they cry seeking sympathy unlike a man your not allowed to cry under no circumstance ni upambane. kids as they grow older they don't fear mothers be it a boy or girl child. a mother is all about love but a father is all about love but by showing you the reality about life. skiza story nyingi za thugs lesbians gays or kids in the street utapata baba hakuwa in their lives. not to shame women but kuna corward men ambao hutia mimba wanawake na wanaogopa majukumu something a man should be told from the time he hits puberty kwamba mwanaume amezaliwa kutumika duniani no matter what you must provide. look after your kids dear men . mwanamke anaweza kuwa nuksi dramatic but remember a kid needs a father no matter what comes may.,13,2025-04-06T05:35:54Z

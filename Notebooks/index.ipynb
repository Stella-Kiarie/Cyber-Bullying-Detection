    "The kenyan digital landscape is one of the most vibrant in Africa, driven by a huge population of young, tech savvy and a high rate of mobile internet usage.  The major platforms for social engagement, entertainment and business being FaceBook, YouTube, TikTok and X(formerly Twitter).  Content creators, artists, vloggers and commentators commanding millions of comments daily.   \n",
    "Due to the anonymity and viral nature of these social media platforms, there is a developing culture if cyberbullying and online hostility. Unlike other Western countexts where comments fall under well known languages, Kenyan  comment section is characterized by code -switching between Kiswahili, English and Sheng. Sheng is mostly being used to deliver insults or to \"roast\" individuals in the online space.   \n",
    "\n",
    "The current global cyberbulling moderation tools are primarily built in well-known languages like English, French, and a little bit of Swahili.  Following the Kenyan linguistic complexity, there moderation tools fail to capture harmful sheng Phrases which leave kenyan content creators, public figures and online users vulnerable to online harrassmenr which in turn results to severe mental issues, reputation damages, suicidal ideation and digital exclusion.    \n",

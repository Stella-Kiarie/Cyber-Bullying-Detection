@BeHonorable244,"i believe in order for change to occur, we also have to change. but we should also remember that change is a slow poisson. we elected ruto and these are the consequences of that election. we need not let our emotions dictate our vote in the coming election...we need to be strategic in choosing our next leader. do not forgive and do not forget...all should keep a meticulous account of all transgressions so that we can refer to them when the time comes. patience is key and emotional detachment is the whip...that is the end game. listen and listen well kenyans, i will say this only once...this world deals in emotional currency...they control you via your emotions. they want you to feel this type of way so that it becomes easier for them to control you. if we elect the new leader via our emotions, we will elect a new leader three times as worse as ruto ever was or could be, simply because we will all be blinded by hate, anger and pure rage. detach from your emotions and you will see the entire playing field...you will see the entire game and you will elect a leader who will merit the seat but also remember that there are those who control that seat. the power behind the power...ruto is but the puppet..there are the puppet masters...who operate in the shadows. so my question is, is ruto really the problem or just a symptom of a malignant tumour in the country we call kenya? who really makes these laws and pushes these agendas...these are the ones we need to root out...these are the source of our problems in this country.",3,2025-05-25T14:06:25Z

@loughrey101,"if the very purpose of the protests was to force their way into the parliament that how could that by any possible logic be defined as a peaceful protest? the protesters were effectively no different to the trump rioters who tried to force their way into the us congressional buildings in order to stop the certification of president biden as president, while in this case, their attempt was to stop the certification of the finance bill. they are both exactly the same situations and video footage shows that the protesters did indeed turn to violence towards the police. while it is a tragedy what happened, there is absolutely no possible way to define what the protesters were trying to do as anything close to peaceful. a peaceful protest is one that simply defined as a large group of people walking through the street and communicating their frustrations, but if the objective is to force your way into a parliament building then that by its very definition is a violent protest.",2,2025-05-21T21:44:23Z

@Airlane1979,"""the documentary fails to explicitly indict ruto and the government for the killings. kenya’s police have a long history of acting with impunity, repeatedly implicated in extrajudicial killings, torture, and disappearances, particularly against social opposition to austerity, corruption and soaring costs of living. the year before, anti-austerity protests led by the opposition were violently supressed, leaving at least 31 people dead and injured hundreds. no serious reckoning has ever taken place. it also pays no attention to the role of imperialist powers. behind closed doors, washington, london, and european capitals alongside the international monetary fund (imf) were working with ruto. their concern was not kenyan lives, but the risk that the protests could destabilise its key regional ally and capitalist regimes across the continent. they advised ruto to temporarily withdraw the finance bill and stagger the imposition of austerity measures to defuse public anger, while continuing to fund and train the military and police. that the bbc is the official voice of british imperialism, cloaked in a fiction of neutrality, is beyond dispute. but kiarie, and the rest of the kenyan political class, are stooges of imperialism. the politicians denouncing the bbc have signed defence cooperation agreements to maintain british military bases in kenya, while ruto himself paid tribute to queen elizabeth ii, the monarch who presided over the brutal suppression of the anti-colonial mau mau uprising that left hundreds of thousands dead. britain remains kenya’s largest european investor, a key donor of development aid, and a strategic partner in military and counterterrorism operations. the arrest of the filmmakers epitomizes the profound crisis of legitimacy facing the kenyan bourgeoisie, which is rapidly sliding back into the authoritarianism of the dictatorship of daniel arap moi under whom president william ruto was a loyal protégé. confronting this descent into barbarism demands the unified mobilisation of the working class on a socialist programme. armed with the lessons of history and guided by the principles of internationalism, workers and youth in kenya must join their struggles across borders in africa, in the united states, europe, and beyond.""

@dra_allan,"as a ugandan, watching the bravery of kenyan citizens standing up to their government gives me both hope and deep sadness. hope—because it shows that united voices can shake systems. sadness—because in uganda, our reality is even darker, and yet the world rarely pays attention. if the kind of investigative journalism being done on kenya’s parliament protests was also done in uganda, we would be extremely grateful. here, the situation is far worse. our police and army don’t use rubber bullets—they use live ammunition. people are abducted in broad daylight, tortured in unknown locations, and many are never seen again. even more shocking is that general muhoozi kainerugaba, the son of president museveni and the chief of defence forces, openly admitted on twitter that he's behind these abductions. yet nothing has been done to hold him accountable or protect the people of uganda. as we approach our general elections in 2026, the fear among ugandans is growing. we’re pleading with international governments, human rights organizations, and media houses like the bbc to turn their eyes to uganda. what’s happening here is not just politics—it’s life and death.",19,2025-05-04T13:30:49Z

@TruthSetter,"what the bbc is doing right now is not journalism. it is narrative control. they waited until the fire cooled, until it was safe, and now they return to stir emotions and reframe the story to suit a global agenda. this is not just about kenya. it is about using kenya as a case study for a wider ideological message. youth versus power. digital rebellion against outdated systems. chaos sold as justice. they highlight voices that fit neatly into their script. loud, dramatic, and always positioned as victims turned heroes. these figures speak the language of the modern left. activism, resistance, liberation. but behind the curtain, it is often calculated, political, and self-serving. yet the media avoids scrutiny. instead, they glorify and amplify. meanwhile, those with conservative, traditional, or religious values are cast as obstacles. there is no room in the story for structure, discipline, or national identity unless it is being attacked or redefined. right-wing perspectives are dismissed or villainized. if you speak up for order or values, you are instantly labeled regressive. this is the core of the modern left-wing system: • it promotes wealth redistribution, even when it weakens local economies • it centers identity politics over individual merit, pushing race, gender, or sexual orientation as primary identifiers • it resists tradition, often attacking religious and cultural roots in the name of progress • it calls for open borders and global governance, even if it erodes sovereignty • it dominates global media, education, and activism platforms, controlling language and silencing dissent • it uses emotional manipulation with terms like “hate speech,” “patriarchy,” or “oppression” not to inform but to dominate narratives now that the country is going through strain again, with economic pressure and rising youth frustration, the timing of their return is not innocent. it is precise. it is strategic. they are reigniting old fires not to help, but to reassert control over the story. to play moral referee in a game they only watch when it serves them. this is not journalism. it is exploitation dressed as empathy. it is ideological warfare, and people should not stay blind to it.",2,2025-05-03T11:55:19Z

@StevenChitimbe,"1. the problem with most african leaders is making decisions when its too late. 2. most african demonstrations end up with violence once the police show up. i can give clear examples starting from this one, at first the citizens just wanted to show how they were not okay with the parliamentarians decision. but once the police started the shooting and all that it's when the protesters also started the violences. 3. im most african countries the police is not owned by the public, rather by politicians, in the name of protecting positions. 4. in most african countries, when a case is involving the ruling part, remains uninvestigated until change of government. or unless private parties such as media intervene. sometimes blood is even spread during investigations. why mama africa 😢",0,2025-04-30T12:26:33Z

@ml-qlight8123,the actions of the kenyan government are shocking. how can a leadership treat its own people like this? it is a good thing the world is seeing the truth through this documentary. william ruto does not act like a president who serves his people – his government does not operate in the interest of the citizens. this documentary deeply angers anyone with a heart.. their time is up... dictatorship!!!,1,2025-04-30T11:19:27Z

@JustHim-r2j,"the bbc’s blood parliament shed light on the shocking events around the 2024 finance bill protests, but many disturbing developments remain uninvestigated. a follow-up is urgently needed — especially in light of the incoming finance bill 2025, which risks repeating the same cycle of public exclusion, government overreach, and elite impunity. unanswered questions remain about what happened after the documentary ends: the june 25th internet shutdown, reported extrajudicial killings, secret cremations, and how some of those branded as traitors were later absorbed into government roles. there are also serious concerns about cabinet reshuffles that seem to prioritize political loyalty over competence, while ordinary citizens continue to suffer without meaningful reform. many who stood up for their rights in 2024 paid the ultimate price, yet those who capitalized on the chaos now thrive. a blood parliament: part two could help ensure that the full truth comes out — and that history isn’t quietly rewritten @bbcafrica",1,2025-04-30T07:19:13Z

@thedve,"echoes of emborogo in the shadowed streets of emborogo, where the sun dared not linger past dawn, aria walked with a rhythm of defiance, her thoughts a quiet storm beneath the veil. she knew the regime's iron rod— a leader's grip like rusted chains, clenching the throats of the hopeful, silencing dreams with the crack of boots. from her window, she'd watched the curfews fall, tanks rumbling like thunder over cracked earth, and in her mind, the stories etched: fathers dragged away for whispered words, mothers weeping in the marketplace void. aria's heart, a fragile bird, fluttered with the weight of what must come— a march for the stolen, the silenced ones. she alone felt the pull, the unyielding tide, her perspective narrowing to this single path. the air hung heavy, thick with the scent of fear, emborogo's capital a cage of concrete and wire. aria gripped the flag, its fabric worn and faded, a symbol of unity, not war— red and gold threads whispering of better days. in her other hand, a simple bottle of water, cool against her palm, a reminder of peace: no stones, no rage, just thirst quenched in the sun. she thought of her brother, lost to the regime's purge, his laughter echoing in her mind like a ghost. ""why this?"" she pondered, steps faltering briefly, as soldiers eyed the growing crowd from rooftops. to aria, the flag was no weapon, but a plea for the light to pierce the dark, the water, a gesture of shared humanity. her thoughts raced: ""we are not the enemy; we carry no more than what sustains us."" yet, in emborogo, even breath could be treason. the square swelled like a heartbeat, voices rising in a chorus aria felt in her bones. she marched at the front, flag held high, its colors catching the fleeting wind. around her, faces etched with quiet resolve— farmers, students, mothers like her own, all armed with nothing but conviction. aria's mind fixated on the simplicity: a bottle to drink, a flag to wave, no hatred in their eyes, only hope's faint glow. but the iron rod loomed, unseen yet palpable, helicopters circling like vultures overhead. she wondered, in that limited haze of fear, if the ruler saw them as threats or mere ants. ""they're innocent,"" she thought, scanning the crowd, ""just people, like me, seeking a voice."" then, the crack of gunfire shattered the air, a storm unleashed from the shadows. aria froze, her thoughts fracturing— the flag slipping in her grasp, water spilling like tears. bodies crumpled around her, innocent forms collapsing in pools of red, their only sins a bottle of water and a flag. she saw a young man fall, his eyes wide with shock, clutching the same simple burdens as she. in her mind, a scream echoed: ""why? we meant no harm!"" bullets whispered through the chaos, and aria's world narrowed to pain— a fire in her side, the flag torn from her hand. she hit the ground, vision blurring, thoughts tumbling into darkness: ""this was not a battle; it was a plea."" in the aftermath, emborogo's silence reigned, the square emptied, save for the fallen. aria's perspective lingered, fading slowly, as medics arrived too late for most. she thought of the water, now wasted on the pavement, the flag trampled under boots of iron. her final breath carried a whisper: ""they killed us for dreaming, for carrying hope."" the world outside might forget, but in emborogo, the echoes remain— a testament to the innocent, their story etched in blood and memory. ~lameck eo",2,2025-04-29T17:24:40Z

@andeyo1,"if the government of kenya will not investigate the killings, abductions, and injuries of innocent and peaceful demonstrators, then it should not be surprised when others do it for them. bbc africa eye's blood parliament is not a foreign plot—it is accountability. the evidence is overwhelming: young kenyans were gunned down, abducted, and brutalized—not because they were armed rebels, but because they dared to raise their voices. what’s even more disturbing is the complete absence of government-led investigations or prosecutions. instead of seeking justice, officials are blaming ""outsiders"" for destabilization. let me be clear: what destabilizes a country is not journalism—it is impunity, corruption, tribalism, opulence, nepotism, and the primitive accumulation of wealth. it is the silence in the face of bloodshed. it is the betrayal of public trust and the abandonment of the rule of law. if the government truly believes in sovereignty and stability, let it prove it not with denials and distractions, but with justice, truth, and accountability.",2,2025-04-29T15:20:46Z
@lonewulfmo9128,thank you soooo much bbc! the documentary has been blocked from local t.v. but 1) this documentary has brought soo much closure to famillies of victims. 2) many kenyans are factoring in the behavior of various leaders in response to this. r.i.p to all the victims.,2,2025-04-29T15:20:10Z

@kenthelegendadvisor,"the events of june 25th, 2024, in kenya were deeply concerning. the loss of life and the reports of excessive force used against protesters exercising their constitutional rights to assembly and expression are very serious. from an objective standpoint, several key aspects warrant attention: * the right to protest: peaceful assembly is a fundamental right in any democratic society. citizens have the right to voice their grievances and concerns without fear of violence or retribution. * use of force: the role of law enforcement is to maintain order, but the use of force must always be proportionate and necessary. reports of live ammunition being used against protesters, as well as attacks on medical personnel, raise significant questions about adherence to these principles. * accountability: it is crucial that there is a thorough, independent, and transparent investigation into the deaths and injuries that occurred. those responsible for any unlawful use of force must be held accountable in accordance with the law. * underlying issues: the protests themselves highlight underlying issues of public dissatisfaction with economic policies and the rising cost of living. addressing these concerns through meaningful dialogue and policy adjustments is essential for long-term stability. * impact on democracy: such events can have a chilling effect on civic engagement and erode public trust in institutions. it's vital for democratic processes to be protected and for citizens to feel safe in expressing their opinions. while it's important to acknowledge the government's responsibility to maintain order and security, this must be balanced with the protection of fundamental rights. the events of that day underscore the need for restraint, accountability, and a commitment to upholding the rule of law in handling public protests.",0,2025-04-29T11:13:09Z

@AO-kq5jw,if anyone is to be held accountable we are going to start from 1969 tom joseph mbona. to 2024. we might be saying “ruto must go” but all this politicians all need to go home let the army rule. every politician. example: babu owino shooting the dj. that’s odm to blame he was never punished even by the party and he’s out there campaigning again for governorship. 2. gachagua promoting ethnicity. 3. kibaki. karua. ruto. uhuru. even raila himself. no one is clean.,0,2025-04-29T09:09:01Z

@buildandmakewithnila,"the question is tax rate in kenya higher than that in the uk, us or france? have people in us, uk and france gone on streets gone on streets to strike? ""kenyans didn't visualize that it's tax that would build their country, not aid and grants. "" this is the real independence ruto wanted to establish in not just kenya but also be an example in africa. for how long shall we africans keep begging, and the aid we receive comes at a cost. so i believe, taxation will help us build our nation with our own sweat just like the countries we see and admire today did. america was built by americans, japan by japanese, china by chinese, france by the french.... no single aid from anywhere. yes corruption is there, but it's a responsibility of every single citizen to fight corruption. it's only referred to corruption when it's not in the favour of an individual,but once it's favouring that same individual, then it's looked at as a connection (not corruption). this is a similar situation just like in us, uk, france... where tax payers money goes in funding political unrests, terrorism and wars causing distablisation across since they benefit from them. for instance, you've had citizens in western countries condemn actions of war in palestine, ukraine... etc, but do their governments listen? so each countries have ways to deal with their issues, and blaming the governments and supporting opposition against policies that would actually help their countries build themselves and be independent, should actually have a limit. lastly, kenya must be built by kenyans ,uganda by ugandans, nigeria by nigerians and africa must be built by africans ,not aid and grants 💪",0,2025-04-29T08:06:16Z

@zimento_,just also keep in mind - this bbc doc being released in this manner + implicating certain agencies is absolutely by design. it’s systematic dissemination of information. it does not mean the info is false… it just means someone somewhere wants it out right now.. this way. one thing you’re taught in social sciences is to question everything. why now? why them? why this way? by who? for what? this is a skill we need to cultivate more of in society as we consume information. position determines perspective. some people will read this and interpret it to mean that we should not believe what we see in the documentary. we absolutely should believe it. the information is very compelling. be angry. act. but the layer beneath that? it says ‘never stop questioning’ - ever,0,2025-04-29T04:39:49Z

@catslove9377,"in the end ruto is still president. innaalillahi wainaa ilaihi raajiun to the dead and patience to the family. you pass by and you find a sign written mbwa kali (fierce dog), will you enter such gate, no. everyone knows parliament, judiciary, state house is a protected zone, yet you find the excuse to enter. whom do you blame in the end. you claim protest to be peaceful but find wanton destruction. damages beyond repair. did you know those marauders were to be left to enter the tunnel, majority of yes mps would be gone case? they would be mauled and skinned alive. not any day did baba raila led demos to parliament, or state house and entered it. he knew it is a protected zone and will take the youth to kibra, kawangware, majengo, pipeline, kware, mukuru. but charged youth wanted to enter the parliament and bring chaos, destruction, pushing super trolley, rice fridges, parliament seats mps could have been killed",0,2025-04-28T22:45:24Z

@Allan_O._Muthiga,"on the bbc documentary, rage manufacturers can't be objective. to them, this was the first time state violence was unleashed on protestors. is it rather so annoying when people forget the 80 people killed in 2023 as others cheered? at the time, wamunyoro boasted so much as he took operational command of the police to direct violence against supporters of odm. no comments from these hypocrites. the documentary followed the murder of three adult males aged between 27 to 39, actively participating in a protest that had turned so violent . imagine what would rage manufacturers say when there's a documentary about 6-month- old baby pendo, 7-year-old mutinda and 9-year-old moraa? those were young lives taken by the police - kids killed in their homes, with impunity, under their matiangi messiah. not in the streets or after storming parliament. and the discussion is not even about proposing a solution - such as a judicial inquisition with prosecutorial powers to investigate government excesses in the post - cok era. and neither can they discuss the decentralization of the npsc, including the re-structuring of the government to enable the effective devolution of certain police powers to prevent a recurrence. i am talking about 9 provincial governments with certain law enforcement powers devolved. how useful is the anger if it can't be channelled to productive use? this is precisely the reason i remain intolerant to the suggestions by the over excited and tactless morons who want odm back to the streets, with their 'we are back to the nyayo era' stories. because luos have borne the brunt of this violence, year in, year out as others comfortably warmed their seats and gave us lectures about the destruction of their businesses by 'people who have no stake in the economy'. let those whose lives matter more than ours take to the streets, at least their plight can be publicized. sisi huwa tunauliwa kama umbwa and nobody cares. we saw a government agency procuring body bags to kisumu ahead of the 2017 elections, and several bodies found floating on the lake days after the election. nobody cared.",0,2025-04-28T19:03:02Z

@antoniomaina,"it is heartbreaking that we lost so many kenyans during the protests, at the hands of the very government meant to protect them. these were ordinary citizens — fathers, mothers, brothers, sisters, and youth — who bravely stood up to demand a better future. their only 'crime' was exercising their constitutional right to speak out against injustice. it is a tragedy that voices calling for change were met with violence instead of dialogue. we must honor their sacrifice by continuing to ask for a kenya where every citizen’s life is valued, where leaders listen to the people, and where justice and human rights are truly upheld. their memories must never be forgotten, and their dreams for a better nation must inspire us to push for meaningful change. my pride as a kenyan lies in the kenyan people themselves — in their outstanding bravery, resilience, and unwavering commitment to building a better nation. it is inspiring to see ordinary citizens boldly holding leaders accountable, demanding transparency, justice, and good governance. despite the many challenges we face, kenyans continue to rise, to speak up, and to push for positive change. their spirit of unity and determination reflects the true strength of our country. it is this courage and hope for a better tomorrow that makes me proud to call myself kenyan.",0,2025-04-28T18:11:50Z

@djriggs8725,"bbc needs to expand their research. the truth needs to be told in complete sentences, and you are missing a huge chunk of the story. basic commodities were taxed in 2022 by the previous administration. the previous administration organized the gen-z protests in a meeting called limuru three. get a translator and watch it. we had protesters who nobody had issue with (the ones talking here). nobody had issue withthem. but later on we had coup-plotters from that limuru meeting who were even robbing those same protesters you are talking to. those infiltrated the protests. everyone was afraid of them. ask any neutral party in the street (not these brokers you were inteviewing). that other group is what police was hunting for, they were extremely violent and they torched several buildings and even planned to invade secure zones like parliament, the airport and even staehouse itself. those were not protesters, they were anarchists. their aim was to topple the govt coz they had no assurances they would get political protection for the looting they had done to the point of crippling the country. that regime had robbed and killed people and they were looking for protection. ignore boniface mwangi, he is just a clout-chaser. you need to get the story from non-commercial actors.",1,2025-04-28T17:22:18Z

@juergenstrenger1032,"i have been spending most of the last 3 years in nairobi, and i was actually there during the unrest. i lived in imara daima, and i saw police and military fire rubber bullets and tear gas containers into peaceful protesters. here is the focal point and main reason for the unrest: in 2024, most young people, regardless of their education, would be happy to have a job paying 30,000 kenyan shilling. in 2024, if anyone had a job paying 70,000 kenyan shilling, they would already be considered as well-off (remark: that's around €530 per month): now let's look at what a member of parliament is making per month (and this is not taking into account that it is safe to assume that every one of them can easily double his income from bribes!): 750,000 mp base salary 150,000 housing allowance (plus a zero-interest, up to 35 millio loan to build a house 150,000 ""adjustment"" pay 350,000 allowance for car maintenance (plus a payment of 7,500,000 to buy a car, per parliamentary term, plus a mileage claim of up to 450,000) 120,000 maximum for attending the sittings of parliament total is then more than 1,5 million ksh per month, plus a superb free healthcare plan. that is 500 times the 30,000 kenyan shilling per month that most kenyans would be happy to have. and then the ruling party goes ahead and decides to put 16% vat on the most basic products such as rice beans, milk etc. but the people taking to the streets are the ""organized criminals"" lmfao",0,2025-04-28T15:47:14Z

@KendiDiana,it’s great that the horrifying levels of police brutality against unarmed civilians blatant disregard of human life and suppresion of basic rights like freedom of assembly have been exposed by bbc africa .as a child i used to believe that the police would do anything for its citizens protect us but from that day my view of them changed.our government continuing aiding the supposed criminals and not letting the investigations take place shows us that this people really need to go.i hope for a better government where we will all feel safe 🤍,0,2025-04-28T15:28:13Z

@faridgetitusmgaya9556,"as a tanzanian, i find myself overwhelmed with emotion—watching the strength, the unity, and the unshaken spirit of the kenyan people brings me to tears. it is not just a protest, not just a documentary, not just another headline—it is the heartbeat of a people crying out for justice, for dignity, for a better tomorrow. the courage i see in kenya is not ordinary. it is sacred. it is born from pain, from history, from a place deep within that refuses to stay silent in the face of oppression. watching those young men and women stand side by side, unarmed but powerful in their conviction, breaks something in me—and builds something too. i cannot help but wonder: what kind of heart does it take to fire live bullets at your own brother, your own sister, your own neighbor? they speak the same language. they share the same streets. perhaps they grew up playing under the same sun. and yet, in that moment of madness, the shooters forgot their humanity. but the people did not. the people remembered. the people held on to each other. and that is what africa needs. that spirit. that unity. that fearless defiance of injustice, even when the cost is high. we need to cry together. rise together. fight not with weapons, but with voices too loud to ignore. i came across a comment on tiktok that struck me deeply. someone asked, “why is kenya so silent?” and someone replied, “because of the documentary.” i paused, searched, watched, and wept. that silence is not surrender. it is mourning. it is respect. it is the echo of heartbreak across a land that has given too much blood to the soil. and yet, within that silence, there is thunder, a storm of hope and resilience, of people who refuse to let fear have the final word. to the heroes whose names we may never know, africa sees you. tanzania sees you. i see you. and i honour you.",5073,2025-04-28T15:26:07Z

@dukewabusia2186,"good work bbc. allow me to engage you on as to why and how you chose people with questionable characters to feature except for the brave photojournalist ademba. your findings are that two of the victims are university students and then you leave it at that? connecting protests to university students and its organizers is very very easy especially if you have an mp who is also a product of the same rot. how i wish you had given us another angle of the calculated mayhem and destruction that was taking place under the guard of selected unifomed police officers particularly from h selassie avenue right down to ronald ngala street. why would protestors spend an entire day trying to get to parliament and once in they leave within five minutes yet the clarion call was occupy parliament, something spooked them while they were within parliament precincts. my eyes run with tears when i see how our brave young men were shot haphazardly by a contingent of uniformed offficers who were acting under instructions from unknown quaters. why didn't you investigate that. i mean even the officers were in on this one. it is evident. how do we have kdf infiltrating the kenya police without parliaments approval. brave young kenyans its high time we know who funded who and why. this documentary comes just a few days after our president went to the east and in a few weeks to come the budget will be read again, why are we being gaslighted yet already we have a budget proposal and everyone is quiet. go back to the national anthem and pray",0,2025-04-28T15:21:59Z

@Bunyipp96,"seeing this documentary evoked some emotions i thought i had processed and renewed my hatred for ruto. the fact that the bbc documentary humanised the victims is powerful and necessary. it gives dignity back to people who were stripped of it by both the rogue government narrative and biased coverage like sam gituku’s documentary, that tried to spin mps as the real victims. i am wondering why they had to deploy the kdf on civilians but then again, there's a deeper culture of impunity, where the leadership feels they can act violently and get away with it. we need to bring that one term president and his ghoulish mps to book. they should never, ever be allowed to get away with this.",2,2025-04-28T09:32:20Z

@disturbed54times,"it is a bittersweet video for me, more bitter than sweet. bitter at how the plights of our people were ignored in the days leading to the occupy parliament protests, then the demonstrations got intense, and they (the fools including nps, kdf and kasongo's chronies) were overwhelmed. some stupid fools played judge on innocent kenyans and ruled their execution in cold blood, unarmed, even with a head-shot to the back of the head. we are in april 2025, in less than 2 months we shall be in june again, no one has been brought to justice, either legally or by 'other' means. kasongo keeps breathing, telling us to live within our means, ipoa wamepoa, citizen tv na kina sam gituku walisema victims wa the occupy parliament protests ni kina ichungwa. the only 'sweet' thing, though nothing similar to the sweet i know, is bbc news africa. this documentary seems to mark the start of closure for most of us. and i hope for the families too. we know who did it: john kaboi, nps, kdf, ruto. we know their faces even. we know the victims, we have seen the victims' mothers, how they were normal people like us, trying to figure out life together in this ruto regime, that they had dreams like us, and they did not commit treason, we did not commit treason. i am an african man, and i cried a lot watching this. thank you, bbc news africa, young ademba alans, may you never lack. may the families live to find closure. we are sorry for the heroic sons and daughters you (the families) lost in the fight for a better homeland for us all. may the souls of our departed hunt ruto from all the seven hells. we will never be scared.",3,2025-04-28T08:21:26Z

@kipronokiprotich2351,as a kenyan i can fearlessly say that this government is ass backwards when it comes to real issues affecting people! the president is a despot whose only priority is amassing wealth and unaliving anyone who poses a significant challenge to his reign! the next general election in 2027 is gonna be one bloody affair!,0,2025-04-28T06:43:58Z
